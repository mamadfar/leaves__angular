# Development Approaches & Considerations

## How I Tackled the Tasks

### Architecture & Tech Stack

- **Full-Stack Angular 20**: Leveraged Angular SSR (Server-Side Rendering) for
  better performance and SEO
- **Prisma ORM**: Used for type-safe database operations with SQLite for local
  development
- **Express.js Backend**: Implemented RESTful API with proper separation of
  concerns
- **TailwindCSS**: For rapid, utility-first styling approach
- **TypeScript**: Ensured type safety across the entire application stack

### Database Design

- **Normalized Schema**: Designed proper relationships between Employee, Leave,
  LeaveBalance, and SpecialLeaveUsage tables
- **Enum Types**: Used Prisma enums for LeaveStatus, LeaveType, and
  SpecialLeaveType for better data integrity
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Implemented manager-employee relationships with
  self-referencing foreign keys
- **Audit Fields**: Added createdAt/updatedAt timestamps for tracking changes

### Business Logic Implementation

- **Dedicated Service Layer**: Created `LeaveBusinessRulesService` to
  encapsulate complex business rules
- **Working Hours Calculation**: Implemented algorithms to calculate working
  hours excluding weekends and holidays
- **Pro-rata Calculations**: Built logic for calculating leave entitlements
  based on contract hours
- **Validation Framework**: Comprehensive validation with errors and warnings
  for leave requests
- **Special Leave Rules**: Implemented different rules for various special leave
  types (moving, wedding, child birth, parental care)

### API Design

- **RESTful Endpoints**: Designed intuitive API endpoints following REST
  principles
- **Proper HTTP Methods**: Used appropriate HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PATCH,
  DELETE)
- **Resource-based URLs**: Structured URLs around resources (employees, leaves,
  balances)
- **Status Code Handling**: Implemented proper HTTP status codes for different
  scenarios

### Frontend Architecture

- **Component-based Structure**: Organized code into reusable components
- **Service Layer**: Separated API calls into dedicated services (AuthService,
  EmployeeService, LeaveService)
- **Guards**: Implemented authentication guards for route protection
- **Reactive Forms**: Used Angular reactive forms for better form handling and
  validation

### Development Workflow

- **Database Seeding**: Created comprehensive seed data for testing scenarios
- **Code Formatting**: Integrated Prettier for consistent code formatting
- **Type Generation**: Automated Prisma client generation for type safety
- **Development Scripts**: Set up convenient npm scripts for common tasks

## If I Had More Time

### Testing Improvements

- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Expand test coverage for all services,
  components, and business logic
- **Integration Tests**: Add tests for API endpoints and database operations
- **Component Testing**: Implement Angular Testing Library for better component
  testing
- **Test Data Factories**: Create factories for generating test data
  consistently
- **Mock Services**: Implement proper mocking strategies for external
  dependencies

### Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for route modules to reduce initial
  bundle size
- **OnPush Change Detection**: Optimize Angular change detection strategy
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large lists of employees/leaves
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement HTTP caching and state management
- **Bundle Analysis**: Use webpack-bundle-analyzer to optimize bundle size

### User Experience Enhancements

- **Error Pages**: Add custom 404 (Not Found) and 500 (Server Error) pages
- **Loading States**: Implement skeleton screens and loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: Better error boundary implementation and user-friendly
  error messages
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Responsive Design**: Optimize for mobile and tablet devices

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Atomic Components**: Create reusable button, input, modal, and form
  components
- **Design System**: Implement consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes
- **Animation**: Add smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Dark Mode**: Theme switching capability
- **Toast Notifications**: Better user feedback for actions

### SEO & Performance

- **Meta Tags**: Dynamic meta descriptions, titles, and Open Graph tags
- **Structured Data**: Schema.org markup for better search engine understanding
- **URL Structure**: SEO-friendly URLs with proper canonical tags
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Better SSR implementation using Angular's
  TransferState
- **Hydration Optimization**: Pass server data to client during hydration to
  avoid duplicate requests

### Code Quality

- **ESLint Configuration**: Strict linting rules for better code quality
- **Husky & lint-staged**: Pre-commit hooks for formatting and linting
- **Conventional Commits**: Standardized commit message format
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments for better code documentation

## What I Would've Done for a Production App

### Development & CI/CD

- **Husky and lint-staged**: Pre-commit hooks for code quality enforcement:

  ```json
  {
    "husky": {
      "hooks": {
        "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
      }
    },
    "lint-staged": {
      "*.{ts,html}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
      "*.{css,scss}": ["stylelint --fix", "prettier --write"]
    }
  }
  ```

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline
  - Run tests on every PR
  - Build and deploy to staging/production
  - Automated dependency updates with Dependabot
  - Security scanning with CodeQL

- **GitHub Pages**: Automated deployment for demo environments

### Testing Strategy

- **E2E Testing with WebdriverIO**:
  - **vs Cypress**: WebdriverIO supports multiple browsers better and has
    superior parallel execution
  - **vs Playwright**: WebdriverIO has more mature ecosystem and better
    community support
  - Real browser testing across Chrome, Firefox, Safari
  - Parallel test execution for faster feedback

### HTTP Client & API Management

- **Axios Integration**: Replace Angular's HttpClient with Axios for better
  interceptor handling
  - Better error handling and retry mechanisms
  - Request/response interceptors for authentication
  - Better TypeScript support for API responses

### Infrastructure & Deployment

- **Docker Containerization**:

  ```dockerfile
  FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY package*.json ./
  RUN npm ci --only=production
  COPY . .
  RUN npm run build

  FROM nginx:alpine
  COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
  COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  ```

  - Consistent development and production environments
  - Easy deployment across different platforms
  - Container orchestration with Kubernetes

- **Environment Management**: Separate configurations for dev, staging,
  production
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for production instead of SQLite
- **CDN**: CloudFront or similar for static asset delivery

- **Storybook Integration**: Component library documentation and testing
  - Interactive component playground
  - Visual regression testing
  - Design token documentation
  - Automated component documentation

### Security Enhancements

- **Helmet.js**: Better CSP (Content Security Policy) headers

  ```typescript
  app.use(
    helmet({
      contentSecurityPolicy: {
        directives: {
          defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
          styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
          scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
          imgSrc: ["'self'", 'data:', 'https:'],
        },
      },
    }),
  );
  ```
